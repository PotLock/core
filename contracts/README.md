## Overview

The Potlock stack contains 5 contracts:

### [Donation](donation)

Provides a means to donate NEAR or FTs to any account, with a protocol fee taken out

### Registry

Projects that wish to apply for a Pot (funding round) may be required to be registered on a project Registry. Flexibility is provided to use a 3rd-party registry; this contract is the registry that Potlock uses by default. Each Pot contract that implements a registry requirement will verify the project against the specified Registry when a project applies for the Pot.
